# 3d-spinning-cube

This project was written in C++.
The project requires you to install GLFW library.

Note: in the main function you can control the way the cube spins by enabling or disabling the "spin_cube_in_#_direction() functions.


The project uses three rotation transformation matrixes.
The conversion from 3d to 2d is done via Isometric projection.
